# Optimization-of-Matching-Networks

Objective Function:

reflection_coefficient: Calculates the reflection coefficient for an L-section matching network using the component values (L, C) and the operating frequency.
Genetic Algorithm Setup:

evaluate: Function to evaluate the fitness of an individual (candidate solution) in the population.
optimize_matching_network: Sets up the genetic algorithm using DEAP, initializes the population, and runs the algorithm for a specified number of generations.
Simulation Parameters:

Z0, ZL, and freq define the characteristic impedance, load impedance, and operating frequency.
Optimization Process:

The genetic algorithm optimizes the inductor (L) and capacitor (C) values to minimize the reflection coefficient.
Convergence statistics are collected to track the progress of the optimization.
Results Display:

Optimal component values for the inductor and capacitor are printed.
Convergence of the genetic algorithm is plotted, showing the minimum and average fitness over generations.
Visualization:

plot_smith_chart: Plots the initial and final reflection coefficients on the Smith chart.
plot_impedance_transformation: Plots the impedance transformation process, showing the path from the source impedance to the load impedance through the matching network components.
